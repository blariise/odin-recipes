      <h4>Steps</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Bring dashi, soy sauce, mirin, and sugar to gentle boil over medium heat.
          Remove from heat and allow to cool.
        </li>
        <li>
          Set out 4 serving plates. 
          Divide equally among plates: dab of wasabi, grated daikon, and scallions.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the meantime, bring 2-quart pot of water to boil over high heat and add soba. 
          Return water to boil and cook the noodles until tender but firm, 3 to 5 minutes. 
          Have ready a large bowl or pot ready with ice water. 
          Use strainer to remove soba from pot. 
          Place soba into ice water and chill until noodles are cold. Drain noodles.
        </li>
        <li>
          Divide noodles evenly between the four plates, mounding the noodles. 
          Pour dipping sauce into individual little bowls to serve alongside noodles.
        </li>
        <li>
          To eat, stir some daikon, wasabi, and green onion into dipping sauce. 
          Top noodles with sliced nori, then take some noodles with chopsticks and dip.
        </li>
